## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

-   Learned how to work with JavaScript in the Browser using DOM.
-   `.nextSibling` will treat even space as the next sibling, so use `.nextElementSibling`.
-   We can change the img src using JS, but most of the times, using picture element tag works better.
